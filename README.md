# FiveDayForecast-iOS

A test code submission

# Scope

This application will show a current five day weather forecast for one specific location.

# Technologies used

Swift, UIKit

# Approach

My intention is to show my understanding of JSON, URLSession, simple data persistence, singletons and MVVM.

# Location of choice

My location of choice is Podington, Bedfordshire (Santa Pod)

# Building and Running

This application should build in XCode without any additional effort on behalf of the reviewer. No cocoapods or carthage skills required.

# Next Steps for this app

It's all very well having a generic application however if I were to release a weather application I would target it specifically, for instance. A weather app for UK surfers which specifically is tailored for what the surfer would want to know for known surfing locations. Hence why I decided to style this test around the race day weather at Santa Pod.

Obviously in this particular applications' case being able to choose a location would be of the most immediate benefit.
